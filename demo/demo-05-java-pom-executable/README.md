Executable Java (POM-based) demo
================================

Take a Maven-layout Java app and ship it as a self-contained native application
image - a launcher with its own bundled Java runtime that a user can run without
installing a JDK. The project is just a `pom.xml` plus a single Java source with a
`main` method and one real Maven dependency (`commons-lang3`), and Jenesis packages
it with the JDK's `jpackage`. It is the executable counterpart of
`../demo-01-java-pom`, and it has a modular sibling that ships the same kind of app
from a `module-info.java`.

Run it
------

From this directory, pass the arguments you want the packaged application to
receive on its command line:

    java build/Demo.java ada lovelace

`Demo.java` configures packaging directly on the assembler -
`new InferredMultiProjectAssembler().packaging("app-image")`, the in-code equivalent of
`-Djenesis.java.jpackage=app-image` with no system property - builds the `stage` goal,
then reads the image folder from the `stage/packages` entry of the map that
`build("stage")` returns (a fixed build target) and launches the produced platform
launcher with your arguments. The packaged app prints:

    Hello, Ada lovelace, from a packaged Maven project built by Jenesis!

(`commons-lang3`'s `StringUtils.capitalize` upper-cased the leading `a`, proving the
bundled dependency is on the launched app's classpath.) With no arguments it greets
`World`. Building the plain `java build/jenesis/Project.java` (no `package` property)
compiles and jars the project exactly as `../demo-01-java-pom` does, without producing an image.

Declaring the entry point
--------------------------

For the build to package a runnable image it first has to know the main class. In
the modular layout that comes from a `@jenesis.main` Javadoc tag on
`module-info.java`. A POM project has no
`module-info.java`, so the Maven-layout equivalent is a `<mainClass>` property in
the POM:

    <properties>
        <mainClass>sample.Sample</mainClass>
    </properties>

Either way the build records `main=sample.Sample` in the module's
`module.properties`. That single field is what both the `Execute` launcher and
the `package` step key off to treat the module as runnable.

Layout
------

    demo/demo-05-java-pom-executable
    |-- build/jenesis        symlink to ../../../sources/build/jenesis
    |-- build/Demo.java       stages an app-image with jpackage, then runs it
    |-- build/DemoNative.java stages a fully bundled native installer (deb/exe/dmg) and reports it
    |-- pom.xml              Maven coordinates, <sourceDirectory>, <mainClass>, one <dependency> (pinned)
    `-- sources/sample/Sample.java   main(String[] args); uses commons-lang3 StringUtils

`Sample.java` calls `org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils`, so the produced image
bundles `commons-lang3.jar` next to the application jar - jpackage packages the
whole runtime closure, not just your own code.

How packaging fits the build
----------------------------

Packaging is opt-in through a single system property, `-Djenesis.java.jpackage`.
When it is set, `InferredMultiProjectAssembler` wires a `jpackage` step into the
package phase - the cross-module level that runs after every module's build - which
produces an application image for every module declaring a main class (modules
without one are skipped). The property's value is the `jpackage --type`; a bare flag defaults to
`app-image`, a self-contained launcher plus bundled runtime that needs no
platform-native tooling. `--name` / `--main-jar` / `--main-class` are derived
automatically (the name from the artifactId, here `java-pom-executable`).

Each produced image is then collected by the `STAGE` module's `packages` step
into `stage/packages/`, the staging analogue of `stage/maven` and `stage/modular`:

    target/stage/
    |-- maven/output/...                 the published jar + pom
    `-- packages/output/java-pom-executable/
        |-- bin/java-pom-executable      the launcher
        `-- lib/                          app jars + bundled runtime

Bundle the jars for a JRE-based image
-------------------------------------

`jpackage` bundles a whole runtime into the image. The lighter alternative is to ship
only your jars onto an off-the-shelf JRE base. For that, `-Djenesis.java.bundle=true`
wires a per-module `bundle` step that writes a single `bundle/bundle.zip` for every
module with a main class:

    java -Djenesis.java.bundle=true build/jenesis/Project.java

    bundle.zip
    |-- application.properties     mainClass=sample.Sample
    `-- classpath/                 the app jar and commons-lang3

Because this is a classpath (non-modular) project, every jar goes under `classpath/`
and `application.properties` carries just `mainClass`. Unzipped onto a JRE base, it
needs no JDK and no jpackage:

    FROM eclipse-temurin:25-jre
    COPY bundle/ /opt/app/
    ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-cp", "/opt/app/classpath/*", "sample.Sample"]

The modular sibling instead splits its jars into
`modulepath/` and `classpath/` and adds a `mainModule` entry.

A single executable jar with the launcher
-----------------------------------------

`-Djenesis.java.launcher=true` turns the bundle into a **single executable jar** you
run with `java -jar foo.jar`, by shading the published `build.jenesis:build.jenesis.launcher`
into the jar root as its `Main-Class` and exploding each dependency into a
`classpath/<jar>/` subfolder (this app is non-modular, so everything is class path).
`build/DemoLauncher.java` builds it and runs the produced jar:

    java build/DemoLauncher.java ada lovelace

The launcher is shaded into the artifact, so it is pinned like any dependency - the
`pom.xml` carries a `<!--jenesis.pin launcher/maven/build.jenesis/build.jenesis.launcher
... -->` block (its own `launcher` group, kept out of `<dependencyManagement>` because
it is not an application dependency). The modular sibling keeps each modular
dependency in its own subfolder and reconstructs them on the module path at run time.

Fully bundled native installer
------------------------------

`Demo.java` builds an `app-image` - a directory you launch in place. Its sibling
`build/DemoNative.java` instead builds the platform's **native installer**: the single
artifact you hand to a user to install. It follows the same shape as `Demo.java` - the
packaging type set explicitly on the assembler, the fixed `stage` target built, the
result read from the fixed `stage/packages` key - and only the last step differs: a
native installer is a deliverable to install, not a program to launch in place, so it
reports the produced package rather than running it.

    java build/DemoNative.java

The packaging type is chosen for the host - `deb` on Linux, `exe` on Windows, `dmg` on
macOS. On Linux it prints:

    Built a fully bundled deb installer under target/stage/packages/output:
      java-pom-executable_1.0.0_amd64.deb (38 MiB)
    Unlike the app-image, this is a deliverable to install with the platform's package manager, not a directory to launch in place.

The installer carries the whole bundled runtime, which is why it is tens of megabytes.
Because this is a classpath (non-modular) application, jpackage bundles a full runtime;
the modular sibling produces a much smaller package, since
there jpackage's internal `jlink` can trim the runtime to the module graph.

Producing a native installer needs the platform's packaging tooling on the PATH (Linux:
`dpkg-deb`/`fakeroot` for `deb`, `rpmbuild` for `rpm`; Windows: the WiX Toolset; macOS:
the bundled `productbuild`/`hdiutil`). For that reason it is run locally rather than in
CI, where `Demo.java`'s app-image - which needs no native tooling - covers the packaging
path.

Where to go from here?
----------------------

The `app-image` is self-contained - it bundles its own Java runtime - so a
deployable container needs no JDK, only a minimal base with a C library. Stage a
**Linux** app-image (run `java build/Demo.java` on Linux or in CI), then copy it
into an image with a small `Dockerfile` (Podman reads the same file):

    FROM debian:stable-slim
    COPY target/stage/packages/output/java-pom-executable /opt/app
    ENTRYPOINT ["/opt/app/bin/java-pom-executable"]

From this directory, build and run it with Docker:

    docker build -t java-pom-executable .
    docker run --rm java-pom-executable ada lovelace

or, identically, with Podman:

    podman build -t java-pom-executable .
    podman run --rm java-pom-executable ada lovelace

Either prints the same greeting the local launcher does.

Because this is a **classpath** application, the bundled runtime is a *full* Java
runtime: jpackage cannot prove which standard-library modules you do not use, so
it ships them all. Measured with Temurin 25.0.3 that runtime is about 136 MB and
the whole app-image about 138 MB, so the container carries a JVM the size of an
off-the-shelf JRE. A modular application would be far
smaller, because it bundles only the runtime its module graph resolves.

Whichever way you size it, this self-contained image carries one guarantee a
shared base image gives up: jpackage builds the bundled runtime from the very JDK
that compiled the code and ran the tests, so the app ships on **exactly the same
JVM** it was built and verified against - not whatever patch version or
distribution a base image happens to provide. The flip side - that a self-contained
image cannot share its JVM layer across *different* services, where a common
`eclipse-temurin:<version>-jre` base can (deduplicated on disk and in the page
cache) - applies here too.
