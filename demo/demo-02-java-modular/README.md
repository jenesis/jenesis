Java (modular) demo
===================

The simplest way to build a single-module Java project that is itself a Java
module: your only build descriptor is `sources/module-info.java`, with no
`pom.xml` to write. You point Jenesis at the project and it resolves the module
you `requires`, compiles your module against it, and produces a modular jar. Its
POM-based counterpart is `../demo-01-java-pom`, and its multi-module counterpart is
`../demo-04-java-modular-multi`.

Build it
--------

From this directory:

    java build/jenesis/Project.java

Layout
------

The whole project is a `module-info.java` plus a source file:

    demo/demo-02-java-modular
    |-- build/jenesis        symlink to ../../../sources/build/jenesis
    `-- sources/
        |-- module-info.java     module demo.modular { requires org.slf4j; exports sample; }
        `-- sample/Sample.java    uses org.slf4j.Logger

With a `module-info.java` and no `pom.xml`, Jenesis selects the MODULAR_TO_MAVEN
layout (`Project.Layout.of`; it is what `auto` resolves to for a modular
project). The build resolves `org.slf4j` as a *named module* (served from the
`https://repo.jenesis.build/module/` overlay), compiles the module against it,
and emits a modular jar plus a generated POM under `target/build/modules/...`;
`stage` then lays them out as both a module repository (`target/stage/modular`)
and a Maven repository (`target/stage/maven`).

`org.slf4j` is a genuine named Java module (`module-info` with a declared
version), which is what lets the module overlay resolve it by module name -
unlike many popular libraries that ship only as *automatic* modules.

Pure modular layout
-------------------

The layout auto-detected above is **MODULAR_TO_MAVEN**: dependencies resolve by
translating each Java module name into a Maven coordinate, and the build emits a
modular jar *plus* a generated `pom.xml` (so `stage` produces both
`target/stage/modular` and `target/stage/maven`), making the artifact consumable
from a Maven repository too.

Jenesis also ships a pure **MODULAR** layout that resolves dependencies purely by
Java module name against the Jenesis module repository and emits a modular jar with
*no* `pom.xml` at all (`stage` then produces only `target/stage/modular`). Force it
from the command line with the layout override:

    java -Djenesis.project.layout=modular build/jenesis/Project.java

(`jenesis.project.layout` accepts `auto`, `maven`, `modular`, `modular_to_maven`.)
Use MODULAR when the artifact is only ever consumed as a Java module and you do not
want a POM; keep the default MODULAR_TO_MAVEN when you also want a Maven-publishable
coordinate.

Pinned dependency
-----------------

This demo ships **already pinned**. In a module-info layout a dependency is pinned
with an `@jenesis.pin <token> <version>` Javadoc tag on the module declaration,
where the token's slash count selects its form (0 slashes is a Java module name,
short for `<group>/module/<name>` with the default group `main`; 1 slash is a Maven
`<groupId>/<artifactId>`; 2+ slashes is an explicit `<group>/<repository>/<coordinate>`):

    /**
     * @jenesis.pin org.slf4j 2.0.16
     * @jenesis.pin org.slf4j/slf4j-api 2.0.16 SHA-256/a12578dde1ba00bd9b816d388a0b879928d00bab3c83c240f7013bf4196c579a
     */
    module demo.modular {
        requires org.slf4j;
        ...
    }

The version is required to resolve the module (the overlay serves
`org.slf4j/<version>/org.slf4j.jar`). Running `java build/jenesis/Project.java
pin` rewrites the resolved version back into the tag and is idempotent. A pin may
also carry a content checksum (`@jenesis.pin org.slf4j/slf4j-api 2.0.16
SHA-256/<hex>`), which `Dependencies` then verifies on every fetch.

The group is the top isolation axis; scope sits beneath it. A project's own
dependency belongs to group `main` (the default), where `compile` and `runtime`
are scopes within that group: runtime inherits the compile pin, so a dependency
that is both compile and runtime is pinned once. Separate resolver groups
(`kotlin`, `scala`, `groovy`, `plugin`) are reserved for the language toolchains
and plugin closures, as shown in the `kotlin` / `scala` and
`internal-module` / `external-module` demos.

Printing the dependency graph
-----------------------------

To see what the build resolves, run the `dependencies` selector. It prints each
module's resolved dependency graph, annotated with the resolved module name and
the declared license:

    java build/jenesis/Project.java dependencies

    main/compile (module)
    maven/org.slf4j/slf4j-api 2.0.16 [compile] (module org.slf4j) {MIT License}

Because this is the default MODULAR_TO_MAVEN layout, `requires org.slf4j` is shown
as the Maven coordinate it resolves to, with a Maven scope. Under the pure MODULAR
layout the same dependency shows as a Java module name (`module/org.slf4j`) instead
- see `../demo-24-module-layout`, which contrasts the two.
