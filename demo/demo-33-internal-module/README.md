InternalModule demo
===================

Drive a source preprocessing pass from a reusable build module - a plugin kept in
its own project, loaded straight from local source - instead of an inline build
step. The plugin performs a `${greeting}` substitution over the project's Java
sources before the regular compile, jar, and test flow runs, and it leans on an
external dependency (`org.json`) to do so. A companion demo runs the identical plugin, but resolves it as a
published artifact rather than compiling it from source.

Run it
------

From this directory:

    java build/Demo.java

which builds the project and then launches the built module, printing the
greeting the plugin substituted in:

    Hello from a source preprocessed by an internal build module, using the org.json dependency!

Built without the plugin the literal `${greeting}` would print instead.

Layout
------

    demo/demo-33-internal-module
    |-- build/jenesis            symlink to ../../../sources/build/jenesis
    |-- build/Demo.java          the launcher (Project + wrapping assembler)
    |-- plugin/
    |   |-- .jenesis.skip       marks plugin/ as its own build root, so the
    |   |                        project's module discovery skips it
    |   |-- module-info.java     module demo.plugin { requires build.jenesis;
    |   |                                requires org.json;
    |   |                                provides build.jenesis.BuildExecutorModule
    |   |                                with demo.plugin.SubstitutionModule; }
    |   `-- demo/plugin/SubstitutionModule.java
    `-- sources/
        |-- module-info.java     module demo.internal { exports sample; }
        `-- sample/Sample.java    prints GREETING = "${greeting}"

The project under `sources/` is an ordinary modular project, exactly like
`custom-assembler`. The build module under `plugin/` is a separate modular
project; its `.jenesis.skip` marker keeps the host project's module discovery
from mistaking it for a second project module.

The plugin's `build.jenesis` dependency resolves from the default Jenesis
repository as the published `0.6.0` artifact (pinned via the
`@jenesis.pin build.jenesis 0.6.0 ...`
tag in `sources/module-info.java`), whose API matches the local sources the host
runs against, so the class-loader bridge loads it without complaint.

How it works
------------

`Demo.java` builds a `Project` whose assembler is a `PreprocessingAssembler`
wrapping the stock `InferredMultiProjectAssembler`, then hands that project to
`Execute`, which builds it and launches the produced module's `main` so the
substituted greeting is shown. `Execute` reads the build's inventory to find the
module and its runtime classpath, so nothing is located by hand. For each module
the wrapper:

1. Adds a `preprocess` node that is an `InternalModule` pointed at `plugin/`.
   `InternalModule` compiles the plugin from source, resolves its declared
   dependencies, loads the `BuildExecutorModule` service provider, and runs it.
   The three-argument constructor wires the **default Jenesis repository** with
   the local export (`~/.jenesis`) prepended, so the plugin's `build.jenesis` and
   `org.json` dependencies resolve from there - nothing is downloaded explicitly.
2. Redirects the descriptor's sources to the module's output with
   `descriptor.sources("preprocess/substitute")`, so the stock assembler's
   regular flow compiles, jars, and tests the preprocessed sources.

The project's sources are passed to the module as inherited steps.
`InternalModule` compiles the plugin in isolation - against only its own sources
and resolved dependencies - and forwards the inherited steps to the plugin only
at run time, where the `substitute` step reads and rewrites them. The substituted
copy the plugin emits then stands in for the originals downstream.

Inside the plugin, `SubstitutionModule` parses a small substitution map with
`org.json` (the external dependency) and replaces each `${key}` placeholder in
every `.java` file. Built with the stock assembler the `${greeting}` literal
would survive verbatim; here it is rewritten before compilation, so the value
that ends up in the jar is the substituted one.

The plugin's `substitute` step is reachable in the build graph as
`preprocess/substitute` (the delegated module's steps surface directly under the
module name), which is exactly the key the assembler redirects the sources to.

Isolating the build module's Jenesis
------------------------------------

A build module brings its own `build.jenesis` (here the pinned
`build.jenesis` `0.6.0`), which is generally a *different* copy from the
Jenesis running the build. To let the two coexist, `InternalModule` loads the
module into its **own `ModuleLayer` with its own class loader**, so the module's
`build.jenesis` never clashes with the host's on a single class path. A
class-loader bridge (`JenesisClassLoaderBridge`) then translates across the
boundary: the host invokes the module's `BuildExecutorModule.accept` and
`BuildStep` methods by method handle, and the module's calls back onto the
`BuildExecutor` it is handed run through a proxy that dispatches to the host's
executor.

This isolation rests on a **module layer**: the module is resolved into a
`ModuleLayer` and discovered there as a `BuildExecutorModule` service provider. A
service provider is found through its module's `provides` declaration, so the
**build module itself must be a named (explicit) module** - this plugin's
`module-info.java` is what makes it loadable as a service at all. Its
*dependencies*, by contrast, are not restricted to named modules: a module layer
admits automatic modules too, so what a build module may depend on comes down to
how those dependencies are resolved. This demo resolves them by Java module name
from the Jenesis module repository (and `org.json` here is itself a named module),
but `InternalModule` takes arbitrary resolvers - wire a Maven resolver and the
closure is fetched by coordinate, which is how an automatic-module or otherwise
non-modular dependency is brought in and loaded into the layer. (The pure MODULAR
*layout* in `../demo-27-module-layout` is the stricter case: it resolves only by
module name and so rejects automatic modules outright.)

Because the two `build.jenesis` copies are isolated rather than merged, a build
module can pin a different Jenesis version than the host without conflict - as
long as the API surface it uses lines up. If a module built against a *newer*
Jenesis calls a `BuildExecutor` method this (older) Jenesis does not provide, the
bridge cannot map it and fails with an `UnsupportedOperationException` that names
the method and tells you to upgrade Jenesis, rather than a confusing linkage
error.
