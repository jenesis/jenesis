Groovy demo
===========

Build a project that mixes a Java type with a Groovy type in one module of the
Java module system. You point Jenesis at the project, it compiles the `.java` and
`.groovy` sources together, and emits a modular jar alongside a generated POM -
there is no build script to write.

Build it
--------

From this directory:

    java build/jenesis/Project.java

Jenesis auto-detects the MODULAR_TO_MAVEN layout (a `module-info.java`, no
`pom.xml`), scans the sources, resolves the Groovy compiler, compiles
`module-info.java` and `Greeter.java` with `javac`, then compiles `Sample.groovy`
with `groovyc`, and packages a modular jar plus a generated POM.

Layout
------

The module declares its dependency in `module-info.java` and keeps the Java and
Groovy types in one package:

    demo/demo-18-groovy
    |-- build/jenesis              symlink to ../../../sources/build/jenesis
    `-- sources
        |-- module-info.java       requires org.apache.groovy; exports sample
        `-- sample
            |-- Greeter.java       a Java type in the exported package
            `-- Sample.groovy      a Groovy type that calls Greeter

How Jenesis builds it
---------------------

Jenesis drives the Groovy compiler through the default
`InferredMultiProjectAssembler`, with the module participating in the Java module
system and emitting a modular jar alongside a generated POM.

How Groovy fits the inferred compiler chain
-------------------------------------------

The inferred chain compiles `javac` first, then `groovyc`. `javac` compiles
`module-info.java` and every `.java` source; `groovyc` then compiles only the
`.groovy` sources and resolves the Java types it references from the classes
`javac` already produced, which are on its class path.

Groovy does not take part in joint compilation here. The `groovyc` joint mode
(`-j`) runs an internal `javac` that emits class files for the Java sources,
which would collide with the leading `javac` step. Jenesis therefore hands
`groovyc` only the `.groovy` files, and Groovy code reaches Java types through the
compiled class path. This is the mirror image of how `kotlinc` and `scalac` work:
those compilers read `.java` as source for symbol resolution but never emit class
files for it, so the leading `javac` owns the Java output in every case.

Exporting a package needs a Java type
--------------------------------------

A `module-info.java` can `requires org.apache.groovy` (it resolves as the
automatic module the Groovy jar declares through its `Automatic-Module-Name`
manifest entry) and can `exports` a package. There is one rule to respect:

A package named in an `exports` directive must contain at least one Java type.

`javac` validates `exports sample` by checking that the package is populated in
its output, and it runs before `groovyc`. At that point the package's Groovy
classes do not exist yet, so only Java types count. That is why `sample` here
contains `Greeter.java`: it makes the exported package non-empty for `javac`. The
Groovy class `Sample` joins the same package when `groovyc` runs and ships in the
export alongside `Greeter`. A package that holds only Groovy classes cannot be
exported; keep it internal (declare `requires` without `exports`) or add a Java
type to it.

For Groovy this is a permanent restriction. `groovyc` resolves Java only from the
compiled class path, so it has to run after `javac`, and its classes can never be
present for the export check. The `kotlin` and `scala` demos do not share it:
because `kotlinc` and `scalac` read `.java` as source, the inferred chain compiles
them ahead of `javac`, so their classes are already in the module when `javac`
validates the exports (`javac` sees them through `--patch-module`). Both of those
demos export a package that holds only Kotlin or only Scala. `groovyc` cannot run
before `javac`, so a Groovy-only package stays unexportable.

Groovy dependency and pinning
-----------------------------

Because the module declares `requires org.apache.groovy`, the Groovy runtime is a
real dependency of the module. With no `pom.xml`, `MavenModuleResolver` translates
the module name into its Maven coordinate (`org.apache.groovy:groovy`) and resolves
it, so `javac` finds it on the module path when it compiles `module-info.java`. The
compiler toolchain that runs `groovyc` is resolved separately in its own
`groovyc` group.

Both groups are pinned with version and checksum directly on the module
declaration:

    @jenesis.pin org.apache.groovy 5.0.6
    @jenesis.pin org.apache.groovy/groovy 5.0.6 SHA-256/...
    @jenesis.pin groovyc/maven/org.apache.groovy/groovy 6.0.0-alpha-1 SHA-256/...

The first two pin the module's own `org.apache.groovy` dependency in the default
`main` group (the Java module name, then its Maven coordinate with a checksum);
the last pins the compiler's copy in the `groovyc` group (resolved from the `maven`
repository, since the Groovy compiler resolves through Maven). Without a declared
version both would float to the latest release - which for Groovy currently
includes pre-release builds - so pinning keeps the module on the stable `5.0.6`
while the compiler toolchain stays on `6.0.0-alpha-1`. Run
`java build/jenesis/Project.java pin` to record or refresh the pins; re-running
leaves the module declaration unchanged.
