Multi-release JAR demo
======================

Build one JAR that runs differently depending on the Java version it lands on. The
module compiles at Java 21, and one utility class is overridden for Java 25; at
runtime the JVM picks the implementation matching its own feature version, so the
same JAR prints a different line on Java 21 than on Java 25. It is a modular project
(MODULAR_TO_MAVEN layout), and its non-versioned counterpart is
`../demo-02-java-modular`.

Run it
------

`build/jenesis/Execute.java` builds the project, finds the module that declares an
`@jenesis.main`, and launches it:

    java build/jenesis/Execute.java

On a Java 25 runtime this prints:

    Running on Java 25.
    Hello from the Java 25 versioned implementation.

Run the same JAR on a Java 21 runtime and the baseline class is loaded instead:

    Running on Java 21.
    Hello from the Java 21 baseline implementation.

That difference is the whole point: one artifact, two implementations of
`sample.Platform`, selected by the JVM at launch from the version directory.

Build it
--------

To build the JAR without launching it, run the project goal directly from this
directory:

    java build/jenesis/Project.java

The `javac` step compiles `module-info.java`, `Sample.java`, and the baseline
`Platform.java` at release 21, then runs a second pass over
`META-INF/versions/25/sample/Platform.java` at release 25. The produced
`classes.jar` carries both copies of `sample.Platform` and a `Multi-Release: true`
manifest.

Layout
------

The pieces that make up the versioned build:

    demo/demo-08-java-multi-release
    |-- build/jenesis                                  symlink to ../../../sources/build/jenesis
    `-- sources
        |-- module-info.java                           @jenesis.release 21, @jenesis.main sample.Sample
        |-- sample/Sample.java                         entry point; prints the runtime version and the greeting
        |-- sample/Platform.java                       the Java 21 baseline utility
        `-- META-INF/versions/25/sample/Platform.java  the Java 25 override of that utility

With a `module-info.java` and no `pom.xml`, Jenesis auto-detects the
MODULAR_TO_MAVEN layout and emits a modular jar alongside a generated POM. The
`@jenesis.release 21` tag pins the main compile to Java 21. Any source under
`sources/META-INF/versions/<N>/` is a multi-release overlay: Jenesis compiles it
in a separate pass with `--release <N>` and writes the classes to
`META-INF/versions/<N>/` inside the JAR. When an overlay is produced, the build
marks the JAR's manifest with `Multi-Release: true`, which is what tells the JVM
to consult the versioned directory.

No dependencies
---------------

This module declares no `requires` beyond the implicit `java.base`, so there is
nothing to pin; the demo focuses solely on the multi-release packaging. For
module dependency resolution and pinning, see `../demo-02-java-modular`.
